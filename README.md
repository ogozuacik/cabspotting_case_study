# Cabspotting Case Study

The cabspotting.org project (now inactive) collected data on each of San Francisco's Yellow Cabs, including position, timestamp and whether there was a paying customer at the time [1]. The dataset has mobility traces of ~500 taxi cabs in San Francisco collected over ~30 days [2].
